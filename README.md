This repository contains all the necessary files (libraries) needed to use both the DRV8833 dual motor driver as well as the VL53L4CD ToF distance sensor in MicroPython.


`main.py` contains example code; all other files are dependencies which have been copy-pasted in from their respective repositories in this same GitHub organization, and they will ***not*** be kept up to date here.
Up to date links to the library files used can be found here: [DRV](https://github.com/AHSPC/DRV8833_micropython), [VL53](https://github.com/AHSPC/VL53L4CD_micropython)
